# Medicine-remainder-using-Arduino
Sometimes patients forget to take the medicine at the required time of medicines. And sometimes patient also forgets which medicine He/She have to take at required time. And it is difficult for Doctor/Compounder to monitor patients around the clock. To avoid this problem, we have made this medicine reminder system for patients using Arduino.
